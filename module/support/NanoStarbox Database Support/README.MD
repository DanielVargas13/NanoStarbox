*MS Access 2016 Compatibility Suite provided by [ucanaccess 4.0.4](http://ucanaccess.sourceforge.net/site.html#home)*.

Feature Support Libraries: [HSQLDB 2.3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSQLDB), [Commons Logging 2.6](https://www.google.com/search?client=markdown-provider&q=Commons+Logging+2.6), [Commons Lang 1.13](https://www.google.com/search?client=markdown-provider&q=Commons+Lang+1.13), and [jackcess 2.1.11](https://www.google.com/search?client=markdown-provider&q=maven+jackcess+2.1.11).

This directory is an independent IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Java Project
configured for MAVEN repository access, which fetches the required
libraries, and compiles them into a single archive which will be located
within this project's [jar/](jar/) folder.

After maven synchronization completes, see the documentation and
sources located in the [source folder](src/java/jar/).

For a walk-through of the Access 2016 feature, see this
excellent [tutorial](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/jdbc/java-jdbc-example-connect-to-microsoft-access-database).
