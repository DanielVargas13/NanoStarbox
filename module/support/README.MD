#### NanoStarbox: Module: Support

*Specification Staging Area*

Some NanoStarbox modules require shrinking to fit within the 5MB
limit of the current specification. Each of these modules, are
pre-shrunk, and will require custom-pre-shrinking with every 
library source update to maintain specification parameters.

[archive](./archive) is the directory which houses the core libraries,
their development sources, and documentation for this NanoStarbox
specification's external core libraries.

[jna-4.5.2-full.jar](./jna-4.5.2-full.jar) is a historical compiled source
record, which contains the libary that was used to compose the
[nano-jna](./archive/builtins/nano-jna-4.5.2.jar), and 
[nano-jna-extended](../../net/nano-jna-4.5.2-extended.jar) features of
of this NanoStarbox specification.
