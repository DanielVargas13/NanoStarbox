#### NanoStarbox: Module: UI: JFX: NanoStarbox Voyager

NanoStarbox Voyager provides a simple way to display Web Content,
using the Java JFX platform. This is useful for devices that seek
a small foot print, but require modern ui capabilities.

At this time, voyager does not have a "kiosk" mode, but it should
have one. The current windowing profile is "simple/html-viewer".

HTML content is specified using the <tt>-s</tt> URL, FILE or SOURCE-TEXT
command line switch.

Additional command switches are available for this application.
See the source code for more options.
