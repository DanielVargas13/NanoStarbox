#### NanoStarbox: Module: UI: JFX: NanoStarbox Voyager

NanoStarbox Voyager provides a simple way to display Web Content,
using the Java JFX platform. This is useful for applications that seek
a small foot print, but require modern ui capabilities. Combined with
the NanoStarbox Core, the realistic capabilities of Voyager are as endless as the
Java Platform and beyond combined with the power of JNA.

At this time, Voyager does not have a "kiosk" mode, but it should
have one. The current windowing profile is "simple/html-viewer".

HTML content is specified using the <tt>-s URL, FILE or SOURCE-TEXT</tt>
command line switch.

Additional command switches are available for this application.
See the source code for more options.
