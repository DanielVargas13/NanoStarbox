*[Extended Library Class Path](./)*

This directory houses functionality which may be required by an
implementation that is not featured in the core library.

These libraries can be used via their official repository access URLs,
however any URL classloading should cache the downloaded data to an
implementation defined local path for both host and client, operational
efficiency.

[nano-jna-4.5.2-extended.jar](./nano-jna-4.5.2-extended.jar) houses
all jna libraries which are not included in the core, but are known by
the core.
